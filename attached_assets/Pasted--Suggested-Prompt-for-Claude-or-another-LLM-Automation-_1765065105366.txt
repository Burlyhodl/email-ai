📧 Suggested Prompt for Claude (or another LLM/Automation Tool)
Since you want to use Claude, here is a detailed prompt you could adapt and feed into an AI tool that does have permission to interact with your email data (e.g., via an API or an integrated platform).

"I need you to process the emails in my inbox related to my campaign for AZ Corporation Commissioner. Focus specifically on emails that are event invitations, notices about political events (debates, forums, town halls, candidate trainings, meetings), or opportunities to speak/attend.

Task 1: Identify and Flag

Identify all emails that fall under the criteria above.

Flag these emails with the tag: AZCorpComm_Event.

Task 2: Calendar Integration

For every identified email, extract the Event Name, Date, Time, and Location (if available).

Add a new entry to my calendar with this information. The event description should include a link back to the original email.

Task 3: Draft Replies

For events that have NOT yet occurred: Draft a reply to the sender (or the registration email) asking to confirm if it is too late to register or if there's any necessary pre-event step I need to take. Use a polite and professional tone.

For events that HAVE already occurred (past date/time): Draft an apology email to the sender. State that I apologize for missing the event, and then ask if there is a future, similar opportunity to participate (e.g., 'Is there another Corporation Commission Debate planned?', 'Will there be another LD12 Blue Bingo Bash?', 'Are there plans for another candidate forum?')."
